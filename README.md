# Medical Modifier

Easily configure medical items including the number of uses, the rate of use (for medkits), and the time is takes to use the item.

This mod was inspired by medical attention and was made to be used as a stop-gap until that much better mod was updated.

## Override Options
By default all option are set to false and need to enabled for affects to take place. Every medical item is included, and you simply need to configure the option to the desired value

## Installation
Like most other mods, simply drop the contents of the zip file into root of your SPT install.
