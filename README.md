# Daedalus-MultiplyWeightLimits
Modifies your PMC's OverweightLimits and the maximum value of InertiaLimits by a multiplier of your choice set in the config, by default 1.5 (50%). At the default value it substantially increases both the maximum weight your PMC can carry, and the thresholds where they will start being encumbered, slowed down and suffer stamina penalties.

Multiplies the following globals:

Globals.Configuration.Stamina.BaseOverweightLimits

Globals.Configuration.Stamina.SprintOverweightLimits

Globals.Configuration.Stamina.WalkOverweightLimits

Globals.Configuration.Stamina.WalkSpeedOverweightLimits

Globals.Configuration.Inertia.InertiaLimits
